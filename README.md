# MuseumOfCandy
This is my first bootstrap project which I made it while learning bootstrap from UDEMY.
It is a landing page of a shop called "Museum of Candy".
It includes HTML and Bootstrap.
A basic of CSS is used to justify a little bit content.
The page is fully responsive and can be seen on any device with any width-size.
